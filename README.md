<h1> Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan </h1>


<h2> Description </h2>
I have created an Incident Response Plan for a hypothetical company to illustrate proactive measures for safeguarding intellectual property, upholding professional reputation, ensuring data integrity and availability, and meeting legal requirements. This project has deepened my understanding of the documentation and strategies needed to secure a business. It has also supported my ongoing learning and development in the industry, providing me with a clearer insight into enhancing collaboration and transparency, as well as mitigating financial risks.
